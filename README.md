# 2048-Game
This game was a fun project/exercise for C# and XAML. 
Each of the different tiles has its colour, and the text automatically resizes itself to fit inside the playing grid of the game. 
There is a high score system, however, it does not currently save your high scores after you close the file. 
All of your moves get put into a history section, for you to later see.
# Controls
This game uses the Arrow Keys to move around the tiles. <br> When you move the tiles, they will all go in the direction you chose, before merging to get larger numbers.
 <br> After every move, a new tile will spawn, being either a 2 or a 4.
# Some Small Ideas
- A fully working Highscore system that creates a file to store the high score in <br>
- The game gives you a code to save your game, which you can then input into the game to restore your progress <br>
- A simple undo button that can undo your last move. You will probably get 10 chances to undo your move in one game
